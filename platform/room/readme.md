### Room Association

The script should be used to associate the physical hardware kit with the corresponding virtual instance.
Run the command:

> python3 room_run.py conf/conf.json [platform_ID]

where [platform_ID] should be replaced with the proper platform ID. Example:

> python3 room_run.py conf/conf.json Leaf_002
